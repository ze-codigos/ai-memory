//! Agent lifecycle hook plumbing for ai-memory.
//!
//! Wire flow:
//!
//! 1. The agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) emits a lifecycle event
//!    JSON over stdin to one of the vendored hook scripts under `hooks/`.
//! 2. Native hook commands spool events locally and drain them to
//!    `POST /hook/batch` (or `POST /hook?event=<kind>&agent=<kind>` for
//!    direct integrations) with short timeouts. Scripts exit 0 so the agent
//!    never blocks on us (lesson from agentmemory #221 — hooks that `await`
//!    REST round-trips can deadlock the engine under fan-out).
//! 3. The server parses the body as JSON, runs it through bounded ingest and
//!    the [`ai_memory_core::Sanitizer`] redaction layer, then forwards a
//!    [`ai_memory_core::Sanitized<NewObservation>`] to the store writer. On
//!    `SessionEnd` it also synthesises a wiki page summarising the session via
//!    [`synth`].
//!
//! Privacy strip is a *typed* boundary: there is no way to write an
//! observation without first passing through `Sanitized::new`.
//!
//! This crate does not read process environment directly; server configuration
//! is resolved once by `ai-memory-cli` and threaded in as typed state.
