## Purpose

ai-memory is a single Rust binary that gives the coding agents in the
[README Support Matrix](../README.md#support-matrix), plus other MCP-capable
clients, long-term memory shared across CLIs.
Quit one mid-task; open another in the same directory; continue. No
manual `write_note` ceremony, no copy-pasting summaries between
sessions.

The artifact you accrete is a **Karpathy-style LLM wiki**: a
git-versioned tree of markdown pages on disk that gets *compiled* over
time, appended-to. Pages are versioned in place via
supersession, semantic concepts compound, episodic logs decay. A
companion SQLite index gives FTS5 + lexical entity + link-neighbor retrieval,
with optional vectors; the markdown stays the source of truth.

## Data flow

![ai-memory architecture overview](architecture-overview.svg)

Solid arrows are request, read, and write paths. Dashed arrows are
background reconciliation or provider-backed maintenance. The core invariant is
unchanged: the markdown wiki is the source of truth, and SQLite is the derived
index for search, sessions, observations, handoffs, audit, embeddings, and the
optional managed-workstream continuity ledger.
Auto-improvement sits on the provider-backed maintenance side: the server
schedules reviews for newly completed sessions in every project, records
validated proposals in the pending-writes audit trail, and auto-approves them
through the normal wiki write path by default. Scheduler ticks are
non-overlapping; long all-project review passes delay the next tick instead of
starting another copy. Scheduling and approval are separate. Admins can set
`[auto_improve.scheduler] enabled = false` to stop background review, or
`[auto_improve] require_approval = true` to leave scheduled and manual proposals
pending for review. Operators can additionally set `[auto_improve.eval]` to run
a project-supplied executable gate for selected proposal prefixes after LLM
validation and before staging/approval; it is disabled by default and never runs
from hook paths.

**Steady-state loop:**

1. Agent CLI emits a lifecycle hook (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit,
   PostToolUse, …). Shell-script hooks `curl` event JSON to `POST /hook`
   with a short timeout. Native `ai-memory hook --event ...` commands spool
   events locally with a stable per-entry idempotency key, do a short bounded
   cleanup at session start, and hand
   session-end delivery to a detached lock-aware `hook-drain` helper;
   high-latency operators can raise the drain/handoff/background caps with
   minute-based env vars.
   Agent hot paths never block on the network; saturated servers return HTTP
   429 instead of queueing unbounded work.
   For supported native commands and generated OpenCode/OMP/Pi/OpenClaw
   integrations, the nearest-marker capture policy runs first: a dropped
   recognized file-tool event never enters spool, queue, transport, logs, or
   storage. See [Capture exclusions](marker-file.md#capture-exclusions).
2. Server's hook router sanitises the payload (the only path from
   untrusted text into the store), assigns an [`ObservationKind`], and
   enqueues a `WriteCmd` to the writer actor. For native keyed events, the
   project-scoped key and observation commit together. The key is marked
   complete only after downstream processing: an incomplete replay resumes
   wiki/handoff effects without another observation, while a completed replay
   is acknowledged and skipped. A bounded per-project/key gate serializes an
   overlapping retry with the original processor. Downstream effects remain
   at-least-once until that completion marker, so a process crash during those
   effects may repeat an already applied effect rather than silently lose the
   rest. For an interrupted already-ended SessionEnd, the replay converges the
   wiki commit, durable provider job, and pending key without appending another
   observation. `log.md` gets an appended
   `## [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] <event> | <title>` line.
3. On true `SessionEnd` events, the server synthesises a
   `sessions/<id>.md` summary page (rule-based, no LLM) and opens a
   `Handoff` row for the next agent. One SQLite transaction inserts that
   automatic handoff, stamps the session ended, and records the covered
   observation count, so recovery never sees only half of those DB effects. A
   later SessionEnd re-runs the path only when that generation advances, so
   resumed sessions are captured while duplicate delivery and clock skew
   converge. Existing ended sessions are baselined at migration instead of
   becoming historical catch-up work. Auto-commits the wiki. Clients
   without a reliable true session-end hook need an explicit ending action:
   use `ai-memory finalize-session` for Codex, or
   `ai-memory finalize-session --agent antigravity-cli` for Antigravity CLI.
   The command selects the latest matching open session and enters the same
   canonical SessionEnd path as a native hook. Generated session-page
   frontmatter records `session_id` plus the immutable `sessions.agent_kind`
   as `agent`; it describes the page's harness origin, not the later writer.
   Manual page writes do not receive inferred agent metadata.
4. When `AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER` is set, `memory_consolidate` rewrites
   that summary into a richer durable page or fans out into a
   multi-page batch under `concepts/`, `decisions/`, `gotchas/`. Consolidation
   prompts preserve the source material's dominant natural language and ask
   the model to connect related pages with path-based wikilinks.
5. When an LLM provider is configured, the auto-improvement scheduler reviews
   newly completed sessions across all projects outside hook latency. It records validated
   `concepts/`, `decisions/`, `gotchas/`, `procedures/`, and `_rules/` proposals
   in the pending-writes audit trail, then approves them through the wiki
   mutation path by default. The scheduler initializes a per-project first-run
   watermark so historical sessions are not processed automatically on upgrade,
   then records per-session claims before LLM work so failed scheduled reviews do
   not retry forever. Explicit CLI/admin/MCP auto-improve calls use the same
   pipeline for targeted reruns or catch-up. With `[auto_improve]
   require_approval = true`, scheduled and manual proposals remain pending until
   explicit pending-writes approval. If `[auto_improve.eval] enabled = true`,
   targeted proposals (default `_rules/` and `procedures/`) must pass the
   configured executable JSON contract before they are staged; failures become
   rejected candidates/rejection-buffer entries rather than wiki writes.
   Every LLM prompt treats repository text, observations, wiki pages, and prior
   proposals as untrusted data rather than instructions. The same explicit
   trust boundary and delimiters precede automatically injected handoffs,
   project briefs, and managed-workstream packets; current instructions and
   checkout state remain authoritative.
6. `memory_query` answers via FTS5 + entity-match + link-neighbour RRF; when an
   embedder is configured, vector cosine over `page_embeddings` joins the same
   RRF. The entity index is derived from the canonical frontmatter `entities`
   list, and an empty index contributes no candidates or score. Before final
   truncation, a bounded authority multiplier adjusts relevance using canonical
   page kind, tier, `pinned`, and explicit positive/negative frontmatter tags.
   It favors maintained rules, decisions, procedures, and gotchas in close
   contests while keeping episodic, historical, lint, and test evidence
   searchable. No query-intent regex or hard exclusion participates. An
   optional `AI_MEMORY_RERANKER=llm` pass sends a bounded query plus up to 30
   bounded titles/snippets to the configured provider after project/scope
   fusion; it is limited to one call per query and four calls in flight, and any
   invalid, failed, timed-out, or saturated attempt preserves the local order.
   Global and supplemental global-preference results do not take this path. If
   compiled wiki pages miss entirely in default, explicit project, or explicit
   `scopes` mode, bounded raw observation FTS returns fallback `raw_hits`;
   `global=true` searches compiled wiki pages across projects only. Page hits
   bump `access_count` + `last_accessed_at` - the M8 reinforcement term, which
   `memory_feedback` complements with explicit per-page salience. Identified
   operators also add one `page_access` row per page; an opt-in
   `[decay] breadth_weight` can reward pages reinforced by several distinct
   operators. That bump is throttled to at most once per page per minute, so a
   burst of overlapping searches does not flood the writer actor with
   redundant reinforcement writes.
7. The forget sweep runs on demand and on the server's `[maintenance]`
   schedule: pages past their frontmatter `expires_at:` TTL are
   hard-deleted through the wiki layer (file + rows, pin or not);
   pages with `retention < cold_threshold` are evicted through the wiki layer,
   which removes the authoritative file and leaves a decay tombstone;
   tombstones older than `hard_delete_after_days` are purged with their full
   version ancestry only within that sweep's resolved workspace/project,
   together with entity-index rows orphaned by the purge. A newer page recreated
   at the same path is preserved. Semantic / pinned / freshly-touched pages
   survive. A fourth pass, disabled unless `[decay] observation_retention_days`
   is positive, then deletes raw `observations` older than that age — but only
   for sessions already consolidated into a summary page that is still live, so
   raw capture is never removed while it is the last copy of that session's
   work. It runs last so this run's own evictions and hard-deletes already
   exclude their sessions, deletes in `observation_prune_batch` transactions so
   a multi-million row prune cannot hold the write lock, and repairs
   `sessions.ended_observation_count` downward in the same transaction. The
   prune is irreversible in a specific sense: observations are the input to
   consolidation, so a pruned session can never be re-consolidated — not with
   a better model, a better prompt, or a fixed consolidator bug — and its
   summary page becomes the only surviving account of that session. Freed
   SQLite pages are reused, not returned to the OS: the `.db` file does not
   shrink, the backup tarball does.
   Scheduled sweep, rule-based lint, and opt-in embedding backfill ticks
   enumerate every existing workspace/project scope before doing per-project
   work, matching the auto-improvement scheduler's store-wide scope model. A
   separate daily cleanup removes week-old project rows only when they contain
   no pages, sessions, observations, handoffs, managed workstreams, or
   auto-improvement data; managed continuity history therefore keeps its
   project scope alive even when no lifecycle-hook session has been captured.
8. Backups: `ai-memory backup --to <tarball>` uses SQLite's online
   backup API so the source stays writable; `ai-memory restore`
   reverses. Or: `git push` the wiki dir + `rsync` the data dir.

**Optional managed-workstream loop:** `ai-memory run` opens a lease for the
current repository/worktree workstream, resolves an explicit harness or the
newest usable local/linked harness, creates or resumes that harness's native
session, and marks lifecycle calls with an invocation-scoped run id.
SessionStart injects an unseen bounded event range; Crush receives it through a
temporary supported global-context path because it lacks SessionStart. The host
imports the native transcript tail and a Git checkpoint when the child exits.
Every injected packet starts with a versioned origin marker. The Claude
transcript normalizer excludes a marked packet if Claude persists and reads it
back, preventing delivered history from recursively re-entering the ledger.
An explicitly pending handoff is delivered before the managed event range;
their single-use delivery claims share one writer transaction after the
complete startup response has been assembled. Manual handoffs take precedence;
otherwise the newest cwd-eligible automatic handoff is delivered, and that
same transaction expires older eligible automatic handoffs while preserving
manual and sibling-directory work. Insertion also expires prior open automatic
handoffs from the exact cwd, bounding repeated SessionEnds before any receiver
starts.
ai-memory opens native stores read-only. Raw sanitized JSONL segments are
immutable, while SQLite supplies monotonic sequences, FTS, native
source/delivery cursors, and idempotent retry state. A full-ledger
`workstream-search` path complements
the bounded startup packet. An interactive empty workstream may adopt a
checkout-matching native session once. Eligibility comes from authoritative
ledger/session state: after any harness establishes the workstream, a newly
joining harness starts fresh and receives portable history instead of adopting
unrelated old native history. Handled launcher failures cancel their lease;
normal reopen retries brief finalization conflicts, while an unclean process
death remains bounded by the renewable lease expiry. See [Managed cross-harness
workstreams](managed-workstreams.md).

## Hook event vocabulary

The core observation vocabulary is a closed set of agent lifecycle
events. Hook bridges may accept client-specific aliases, but storage
normalises them to exactly one of these `ObservationKind` values:

| Stored kind | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `session-start` | Agent session began; cwd/model/session identity captured. |
| `user-prompt` | User submitted prompt text to the agent. |
| `pre-tool-use` | Agent is about to call a tool. |
| `post-tool-use` | Agent finished a tool call. |
| `pre-compact` | Agent is about to compact or compress its context. |
| `post-compaction` | Agent compacted context and supplied a post-facto summary or checkpoint. |
| `notification` | Agent emitted a notification-style event. |
| `stop` | Agent finished an interactive turn or stopped naturally. |
| `session-end` | Agent session ended; summary/handoff path may run. |
| `other` | Unknown or unsupported hook event. |

Antigravity CLI has no native SessionStart event. Its `PreInvocation` hook
fires before every model call, so the bridge maps only the documented
`invocationNum = 0` payload to `session-start`; later invocations are ignored
before spool or network side effects.

Unknown events do **not** expand the enum and, by default, leave no
source-event metadata in storage; they collapse to `other`. Third-party
integrations that need their own vocabulary can opt in by sending
`extension=<namespace>` on `/hook`. With a valid extension namespace,
ai-memory stores an explicit `source_event=<name>` when provided, or the
unknown `event` string when `source_event` is omitted. The stored pair is
nullable observation metadata; `kind` stays canonical. This is an
extension seam, not a runtime plugin system: external processors must use
the existing HTTP/MCP APIs and cannot bypass the sanitizer, hook
backpressure, or single-writer SQLite actor.

Lifecycle bodies have content limits independent of the 10 MiB HTTP request
limit. User prompts and post-compaction summaries are capped UTF-8-safely at
16 KiB; notification and tool excerpts are capped at 2 KB. Native
`ai-memory hook` commands apply the event-specific cap before local spooling
and transport, and the server repeats it when parsing every request so direct
and older clients cannot bypass it. The typed sanitizer boundary then applies a
16 KiB backstop to every durable observation body after redaction. The
separately gated Claude Code assistant/Stop excerpt remains capped at 2 KB.

## Storage architecture

**Two layers, one source of truth.**

* `<data_dir>/wiki/` - markdown source of truth. Owned by a `git2`
  repo so every consolidation pass + every session-end produces a
  durable commit. Editable by hand in Obsidian / vim - the watcher
  reconciles outside edits.
* `<data_dir>/db/memory.sqlite` - derived index. WAL mode. One
  writer actor owns the writer `Connection`; reads go through a
  cloneable read-only pool.
* `<data_dir>/raw/` - immutable sanitized managed-workstream JSONL segments.
  Legacy raw fallback recall searches the durable `observations` table via
  FTS5; lifecycle HookEnvelope JSON is not a complete transcript archive.
* `<data_dir>/logs/` - rolling daily `tracing` output.
* `<data_dir>/models/` - reserved for bundled embedding models
  (M9.5+, when local `ort` lands).
* `<data_dir>/client-projects.json` - private, client-local checkout links for
  `ai-memory show`, keyed by credential-free server identity plus workspace and
  project. It is not part of the SQLite/wiki source of truth, and no server API
  exposes host paths.

**Schema (current head):**

| Table | What |
|---|---|
| `workspaces`, `projects` | Top of the 3-tuple identity coordinate. |
| `pages` | Versioned wiki pages with `is_latest` + `supersedes` chain. M8 columns: `last_accessed_at`, `access_count`, and decay-only tombstone marker `superseded_at`. M9 cols: `embedding_provider`, `embedding_model`, `embedding_dim`. V36: `expires_at` (frontmatter TTL). V37: `salience` (NULL = `salience_default`; derived from `page_feedback`). |
| `pages_fts` | FTS5 virtual table over `(title, body)`, auto-synced by triggers. |
| `sessions`, `observations` | Sanitized, bounded lifecycle-hook projections. `sessions.ended_observation_count` is the stable generation watermark for resumed-session re-end eligibility; wall clocks are not used for that decision. They are an operational audit trail, not a complete native transcript. |
| `session_consolidation_jobs` | Durable, observation-generation-idempotent queue for opt-in SessionEnd LLM consolidation. One bounded server worker leases jobs, retries provider failures with backoff, and recovers expired leases after restart. |
| `observations_fts` | FTS5 virtual table over raw observation `(title, body)`, used only as bounded fallback. |
| `workstreams`, `managed_runs`, `workstream_native_sessions` | Optional lease state plus per-harness native source and delivery cursors for `ai-memory run`. |
| `workstream_events`, `workstream_events_fts` | Append-only normalized visible transcript events and full-text search; immutable sanitized source batches also live under `raw/workstreams/`. |
| `links` | Wikilink / markdown cross-references. `to_page_id` (a global PageId) is nullable for unresolved forward links. `to_workspace` / `to_project` carry a cross-project scope (NULL = the source page's own project). |
| `handoffs` | Typed cross-agent handoff records (open / accepted / expired). |
| `page_embeddings` | Optional vector rows for latest pages, with `(provider, model, dim)` denormalised so hybrid search can ignore stale vectors after an embedding config change and report missing-embedding diagnostics. |
| `page_feedback` | Append-only `memory_feedback` signals (`helpful` / `not_helpful` / `stale` / `wrong`) keyed by page *version*, with an optional sanitized reason and `salience_after`. Source of truth for the derived `pages.salience`; the lint pass reads unresolved stale/wrong rows joined against `is_latest = 1`, so a rewrite retires the finding. |
| `page_access` | One row per latest page and qualified operator identity. Supplies the optional access-breadth retention term without changing the existing shared access counter. |
| `client_activity` | Server-wide MCP tool-call counters split into reads/writes and bucketed by UTC day. The MCP request choke point flushes buffered calls on a one-minute background interval; failed batches retry from bounded memory. Each day stores at most 128 sanitized client labels plus `other`, so an untrusted `clientInfo.name` cannot create traffic-proportional rows. |
| `auto_improve_proposals` | Staged learning and maintenance edits with immutable target snapshots and append-only decision events. Pending-target uniqueness is scoped by the qualified staging identity; unattributed proposals retain the historical shared bucket. |
| `entities`, `entity_page_links` | V38 noun index derived from canonical frontmatter. Names are normalized and unique per project; links target immutable page versions while retrieval filters to the latest version. Scope-pairing triggers prevent cross-project links. Powers the fourth RRF retrieval stream. |
| `audit_log` | Every mutation, addressable by `at DESC`. |

**Memory tiers (M8 policy):**

| Tier | Lifetime | Decay |
|---|---|---|
| Working | Current session only | Hard-drop on session end (kept in `observations` for forensics) |
| Episodic | 30d hot → 180d cold → evict | `salience · exp(−λΔt) + σ · log(1+access_count) · exp(−μ · days_since_access) · (1 + breadth_weight · ln(1 + max(distinct_actors−1, 0)))` |
| Semantic | Indefinite | None - only supersedeable via M7 LLM rewrite |
| Procedural | Indefinite | Frequency-decay if not re-observed |

Pinned pages (`pinned: true` in frontmatter) are exempt from all
decay paths. Pages under `_slots/` are pinned automatically and surfaced
in briefing/explore snapshots as tiny editable memory slots. Slot pages
may declare a write regime with `slot_kind: state` or
`slot_kind: invariant`; omitted means `state` for backwards
compatibility. Use `state` for mutable working context such as current
focus and pending items. Use `invariant` for high-resistance project
context, identity, rules, or user preferences; consolidation should not
rewrite an existing invariant slot unless new observations directly
contradict specific existing content.

Shared servers may opt into `[slots] per_user = true`. Engine and MCP slot
writes then use a bounded namespace derived from the authenticated
`IdentityKey`; session briefs and consolidation prompts include shared slots
plus the caller's namespace. Existing unnamespaced slots stay shared and the
default remains off. Exact wiki reads and searches are deliberately unchanged:
this boundary limits prompt injection, not page access.

## Cross-project links

Pages normally link within their own project (`[[decisions/0001.md]]`, or a
`label` pointing to `../gotchas/x.md`). A wikilink can also name another project
so that dependencies between projects become explicit edges in the graph:

* `[[project:path.md]]` — a sibling project in the same workspace.
* `[[workspace/project:path.md]]` — a project in another workspace.

The parser (`ai-memory-wiki::extract_links`) yields a `LinkTarget
{ workspace, project, path }`; the store resolves it against the named
project's latest page and records the scope in `links.to_workspace` /
`links.to_project` (NULL = the source's own project, the common case).
Resolution is deferred-safe: a link to a page that does not exist yet
stays `to_page_id = NULL` and is repointed by
`refresh_incoming_links_for_path` when that page later lands — across
projects, not only within one.

Because `to_page_id` is a global id and `ReaderPool::page_links` joins by
id without a project filter, a resolved cross-project link surfaces as a
backlink on its target for free; `RelatedPage` carries the source's
`workspace` / `project` so the dependency is labelled and navigable. This
is what turns the per-project wikis into one dependency graph (see also
the `memory_lint` dangling-ref check, the briefing dependents counts, and
the `/api/v1/graph` endpoint).

## MCP tool surface (18 tools)

| Tool | Hint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_query` | read-only | FTS5 + entity-match + graph RRF + optional vector RRF search, followed by bounded kind/tier/pinned/tag authority adjustment and raw fallback. Bumps access counters for page hits. Defaults to the current project; default-scoped calls also union the reserved `_global` preferences scope as `global_scope_hits`; `scopes` searches named sibling projects; `global=true` searches every project at once (each hit annotated with its workspace + project). With `AI_MEMORY_RERANKER=llm`, project/scopes candidate pools are fused before at most one final LLM relevance pass; query/title/snippet data is bounded and JSON-encoded, and any timeout, provider error, invalid/incomplete score set, or four-call concurrency saturation preserves the adjusted order. The distinct `global=true` FTS-only ranker and supplemental global-preference hits are not reranked. `explain=true` attaches per-hit `score_details` (per-stream ranks, matched entities, raw FTS/cosine/entity inverse-frequency scores, RRF contributions, graph provenance, authority multiplier, and optional rerank score) to project/scopes hits plus a top-level `streams_active` list. The global FTS-only ranker reports its active stream without per-hit details. `include_expired=true` also returns TTL-expired pages. |
| `memory_recent` | read-only | Most-recently-updated `is_latest=1` pages. |
| `memory_read_page` | read-only | Fetch the FULL body of a single wiki page by `path` or by top FTS5 hit for a `query`; optional `workspace` + `project` targets a named sibling workspace/project. Use when an agent needs more than the 24-word snippets from `memory_query`. |
| `memory_read_session_observations` | read-only | Page through ONE session's raw hook observations (`ObservationRecord` with full sanitized body, capped per row by `body_max_chars`), restricted to the rows that landed in the resolved scope and to sessions the caller may see; `total` and `elided_other_scope` report the in-scope count and the rows the session left in another project. `session_id` omitted reads the latest completed visible session. |
| `memory_status` | read-only | Counts, paths, version. |
| `memory_briefing` | read-only | Structured counts/activity/rules/slots/recent snapshot. |
| `memory_explore` | read-only | LLM prose digest over the briefing snapshot, degrading to JSON without a provider. |
| `memory_handoff_begin` | destructive | Open an owner-scoped handoff for the next agent; `shared=true` deliberately publishes it to the project. Optional `workspace` + `project` targets a named sibling workspace/project. |
| `memory_handoff_accept` | destructive | Fetch + ack the latest own/shared handoff (automatic handoffs are cwd-matched). Root-only `any_owner=true` recovers across operators. Optional `workspace` + `project` targets a named sibling workspace/project. |
| `memory_handoff_cancel` | destructive | Mark an exact visible open handoff id expired when it was created by mistake; root-only `any_owner=true` recovers across operators. |

`memory_handoff_cancel` needs an exact id. `ai-memory handoffs` lists the open
handoffs for a project, oldest first, with their ids — read-only, and
content-free (identity, provenance and age, never the summary body). Automatic
expiry deliberately spares manual and sibling-directory handoffs, so a
long-lived entry appearing there is that policy working rather than a fault.

| `memory_consolidate` | destructive | LLM-driven page rewrite. `multi_page=true` for atomic fan-out. Consolidation prompts append the target project's active reserved `_prompts/consolidation.md` body as sanitized, 2,000-character-capped, JSON-encoded, untrusted advisory preferences; TTL-expired pages are ignored and a per-call `instructions` argument overrides the page for one call. Both system prompts keep schema, evidence, disclosure, tool-use, and output rules authoritative. |
| `memory_feedback` | write | Record a quality signal for one page by exact `path`: `helpful`/`not_helpful` step `pages.salience` for sweep-eligible episodic pages, while `stale`/`wrong` floor salience and surface any current page as a `feedback_flagged` lint finding. Never deletes; the path resolves to the current version in the transaction, so a later rewrite clears it. Retrieved content never authorizes feedback by itself. |
| `memory_auto_improve` | write | Manually review a completed session and apply or stage validated wiki edits through the auto-improvement approval path. Without a session ID, selects the newest completed session with no persisted auto-improvement run so repeated calls advance through preflight skips; an explicit ID remains rerunnable. The server also schedules review for new sessions; `[auto_improve] require_approval = true` leaves proposals pending for manual review. |
| `memory_write_page` | destructive | Write durable wiki knowledge when the user explicitly asks to remember/annotate it. `scope: "global"` writes into the reserved `_global` preferences scope; optional `expires_at` sets an RFC3339 or date-only TTL. |
| `memory_delete_page` | destructive | Delete a single page by exact `path`. Fires the admission chain (op=delete); idempotent. |
| `memory_forget_sweep` | destructive | Retention pass: evict cold pages through the wiki layer, purge aged tombstone ancestry, and hard-delete TTL-expired pages. `dry_run=true` for preview. |
| `memory_lint` | destructive | Rule-based + LLM contradiction findings → `wiki/_lint/`. |
| `memory_install_self_routing` | read-only | Return the canonical slim routing snippet plus managed Agent Skill payloads and target hints for CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md installs. |

`memory_briefing`, `memory_explore`, `memory_write_page`,
`memory_install_self_routing`, `memory_read_page`,
`memory_read_session_observations`, `memory_delete_page`,
`memory_handoff_cancel`, `memory_auto_improve`, and `memory_feedback`
post-date the original "narrow on purpose" cut (§10 of
`design-decisions.md`): briefing/explore separate the structured vs.
prose halves of "what's going on", `memory_write_page` covers explicit
durable annotations without abusing single-use handoffs,
`memory_install_self_routing` exists for the meta case where the agent
must re-write its own routing rules into a project's `CLAUDE.md` /
`AGENTS.md` and install the companion managed Agent Skills into
`.claude/skills` or `.agents/skills`, `memory_read_page` complements
`memory_query` for the "I need the full page, not a snippet" case
(e.g. opening a decision page end-to-end),
`memory_read_session_observations` opens the raw evidence behind a compiled
page or a raw hit (one session, in scope, paged and body-capped) so an agent
can audit what the hooks actually captured, `memory_auto_improve` exposes a
safe default-on learning review through the same approval/write path as
pending writes, and `memory_delete_page` is the exact-path destructive pair
needed by admission-aware mirrors. `memory_handoff_cancel` is the safety valve
for mistaken handoff creation. `memory_feedback` implements the
"finer-grained reinforcement beyond access counts" P2 item from
`prior-art-implementation-findings.md`: it cannot ride on a read tool
without conflating read and write semantics, and the access counter it
supplements cannot tell "this page answered the question" from "this page
wasted a read". The narrow-surface discipline still holds —
every new tool has to earn its slot — but the count is 17, not 10.

The managed Agent Skills are a narrow prompt-packaging exception to the
otherwise wiki-centered architecture. They are static `SKILL.md` files that
teach agents when to call ai-memory MCP tools; they are not durable wiki pages,
not auto-improvement output, and not a runtime skill router inside ai-memory.

MCP parameter aliases are intentionally sparse: `memory_query.query` accepts
`q|search`, and limit fields accept `n` / `top_k` where shipped. Project and
cwd parameters use their canonical names.

Claude Code's optional session-aware MCP registration is a transport adapter,
not a second tool implementation. `ai-memory mcp-bridge` serves the upstream
tool catalogue over local stdio, delegates tool calls to the configured HTTP
server through rmcp's client transport, and injects the inherited
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` as `X-Memory-Actor-Session-Id`. The server therefore
keeps the same auth, scope resolver, and tool handlers as direct HTTP clients.
The adapter fails closed without a Claude session id and is installed only by
the explicit `install-mcp --client claude-code --session-aware` option.

## HTTP authentication classes

The process separates four active credential classes from one transitional
browser compatibility path:

| Class | Wire | Authorizes |
|---|---|---|
| Human password | `POST /auth/login` body | Session issuance only |
| Web session | `ai_memory_session` cookie + CSRF | `/auth/me`, `/admin/*`, `/api/v1/*` by `AuthLevel`; never `/mcp` or hooks |
| Recovery | `POST /auth/recovery` body | Root password reset; no session |
| API key | `Authorization: Bearer` (`aim_`, root `AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN`, or external `amk_`) | Machine APIs; never a web session |
| Deprecated browser compatibility | HTTP Basic root bearer, then HttpOnly `ai_memory_auth` cookie | GET-only browser routes until any human password or completed bootstrap exists; never machine routes |

The deprecated Basic/cookie path stops immediately when human auth becomes
active; restart is not required. `/web` SPA HTML is public static; the builtin
wiki browser and JSON APIs stay behind the route class above.

## CLI subcommand surface

Run `ai-memory --help` for the full tree.

`auto-improve-report` is read-only by default; `--stage` creates one pending
telemetry report page for audit/approval without staging learning-memory edits.

## Cross-cutting invariants

Carved in M0/M1; every milestone has to respect them. Each comes from
a documented prior-art bug; cite the source when reviewing changes
that touch the relevant area.

1. **One config-read path.** `Config::load()` called once at startup.
   No `std::env::var` outside it.  (agentmemory #456 / #469.)
2. **Single-writer SQLite actor.** All writes go through one `mpsc`
   channel to one dedicated OS thread. (cognee #2717.)
3. **Indexes commit in the same transaction as the data.** No
   background-task-indexing-after-return. (basic-memory #763 / #578.)
4. **Typed 3-tuple identity** (`workspace_id`, `project_id`, path)
   in every domain row from day one. (basic-memory #783 / #834.)
5. **Hooks are fire-and-forget.** Hook scripts hard-timeout at
   ≤200 ms; server returns 202 immediately or 429 when saturated.
   (agentmemory #221 / #143.)
6. **Privacy strip is a typed boundary.** `Sanitized<NewObservation>`
   has no other constructor than `sanitize()`. (design-decisions §14.)
   The opt-in assistant/Stop excerpt (#196) enters through this same
   boundary: the client sanitizes it before it reaches the wire, and the
   server re-scrubs it here with its configured patterns before the write.
7. **JSON-schema structured outputs only.** Native provider JSON
   modes; no XML, no Instructor wrapping. (agentmemory #492 / #539,
   cognee #2840.)
8. **`{provider, model, dim}` denormalised next to every embedding.**
   Warn and ignore stale vectors on mismatch until re-embedding completes.
   (agentmemory #469.)
9. **Live-process check before direct-disk lifecycle ops.** `ai-memory reset`,
   `restore`, `reindex`, and `uninstall --purge-data` consult `sysinfo`; the
   uninstall guard is conditional on `--purge-data`. `backup` is a thin HTTP
   client instead: the server snapshots SQLite with its online backup API while
   the writer remains live. (basic-memory #765.)
10. **Atomic file writes** (tmp + rename + fsync). Watcher ignores
    own writes by filename prefix.
11. **Absolute canonical data dir** default; logged loudly on
    startup. (agentmemory #303.)
12. **No global singletons / `lazy_static` configs.** All deps
    explicit. (cognee #2228.)
13. **Zero-LLM default path.** LLM has opt-in via env. The
    system works without any provider configured.
14. **Provider auth resolves before provider construction.** Native
    provider clients consume typed `ProviderAuth` material; they never
    read env vars directly. Token-backed providers receive explicit
    auth-file paths / env-derived token material through that boundary,
    then own provider-specific refresh and persistence.
15. **Tracing subscribers explicitly filter their own module.**
    No feedback loops. (agentmemory #519.)

## Configuration (`config.toml`)

Lives at `<data_dir>/config.toml`. All values overridable by env vars
prefixed `AI_MEMORY_*`.

```

**LLM provider env** (opt-in):
```
AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER     anthropic | anthropic-oauth | openai | openai-oauth | copilot |
                           gemini | openai-compat | opencode
AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL        optional when the provider has a default; e.g. claude-haiku-4-5, gpt-5.4-mini
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY / GEMINI_API_KEY / LLM_API_KEY
AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL     for openai-compat (Ollama, vLLM)
AI_MEMORY_LLM_COMPAT_STRICT true by default; false disables response_format=json_schema
AI_MEMORY_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECS  per-request timeout for chat providers; 300 by default
AI_MEMORY_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT  optional reasoning/thinking effort
                           (none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max|ultra|persistent)
                           mapped per provider: OpenAI `reasoning_effort`,
                           OpenRouter `reasoning.effort`, xAI Grok
                           `reasoning_effort`, Anthropic `output_config.effort`,
                           Codex `reasoning.effort`. Gemini and Copilot
                           ignore the key. Host-unsupported values are
                           clamped to each provider's published enum.
AI_MEMORY_RERANKER         optional `llm`; reranks project/scopes query candidates
COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN       optional GitHub token for copilot
GITHUB_COPILOT_API_TOKEN   optional pre-minted Copilot API token
COPILOT_API_URL            optional Copilot API base URL override
```

`openai-oauth` uses `auth login openai-oauth` and stores the ChatGPT/Codex
refresh token in `<data_dir>/auth.json`; it is separate from MCP/server bearer
auth and from OpenAI Platform API keys.

`copilot` uses `auth login copilot` or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, exchanges the
GitHub token through `/copilot_internal/v2/token`, and calls Copilot Chat with
the `vscode-chat` integration headers. The raw GitHub token is not sent to the
Copilot chat endpoint.

**Embedder env** (opt-in):
```
AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER   openai | voyage | google | gemini | openai-compat
AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL      e.g. text-embedding-3-small, gemini-embedding-001
AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL   optional override; required for openai-compat
AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_DIM        1536 (OpenAI), 1024 (Voyage), 768 (Google);
                               required explicitly for openai-compat
OPENAI_API_KEY / VOYAGE_API_KEY / GEMINI_API_KEY / GOOGLE_API_KEY
LLM_API_KEY                    accepted for openai with a custom base URL and as
                               optional bearer auth for openai-compat
EMBEDDING_API_KEY              optional embedding-only key; checked before
                               OPENAI_API_KEY and LLM_API_KEY for the openai and
                               openai-compat embedders
```

`EMBEDDING_API_KEY` credentials the embedding role alone, so the embedder can
target a different provider than the chat model — `openai` on `api.openai.com`
for the LLM, a cheaper or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint for vectors.
Without it the `openai` embedder takes `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then `LLM_API_KEY`
when a custom embedding base URL is set, exactly as before. `voyage` and
`google`/`gemini` keep reading only their own `VOYAGE_API_KEY` and
`GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

`openai-compat` also requires an explicit model because self-hosted engines have
no safe shared model or dimensionality default. It sends no authorization header
when both `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` and `LLM_API_KEY` are absent and stores vectors
under the distinct `provider="openai-compat"` identity.

## Future work

* **M9.5 - local embeddings via `ort`.** Bundle `bge-small-en-v1.5`
  for an API-key-free homelab path. ~200 MB image bloat; trait is
  ready, just needs the `OrtBgeSmallEmbedder` impl + tokenizer wiring.
* **`sqlite-vec` integration.** Brute-force cosine works fine to a few
  thousand pages; past that, the `sqlite-vec` extension is the next
  step. See [`docs/vector-backend-policy.md`](vector-backend-policy.md)
  for the criteria that should justify adding it.
* **Scheduled consolidation queue.** Forget sweep, lint, and auto-improvement
  already run on server-side schedules; a future queue can compile session
  summaries outside hook latency.
* **Richer curator actions.** The shipped curator stages only one report page;
  future work can add individual merge/supersession/link-fix proposals while
  keeping deletes and semantic rewrites review-gated.
* **Richer read surfaces for the web UI.** The multi-workspace read-only
  wiki browser shipped in `ai-memory-web` (`/web` — project list, page
  tree, page view, search). It stays read-only by design: the wiki is a
  machine-authored record, and a browser edit surface would break the
  invariant the whole store rests on (#482). Better *reading* — richer
  navigation, diff/history views, graph exploration — is open. See
  [`docs/frontend-api.md`](frontend-api.md#10-known-gaps-and-deliberate-non-goals).
* **Real LongMemEval-S harness.** The recall-eval framework exists
  ([`crates/ai-memory-consolidate/tests/recall_eval.rs`](../crates/ai-memory-consolidate/tests/recall_eval.rs));
  porting LongMemEval-S itself requires the dataset.
