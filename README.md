## Why ai-memory

Your coding agent already has a memory feature. Claude Code takes its own
notes, Cursor remembers some things, and every platform is adding more. All
of them share the same walls: the notes live on one machine, belong to one
agent, and vanish from view the moment you switch tools — or teammates.

ai-memory is what's on the other side of those walls.

- **It follows you across agents.** Twenty-plus harnesses — Claude Code,
  Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Grok, Devin, Kimi, Kiro, and more —
  feed one shared memory. Quit Claude Code mid-task, open Codex in the same
  directory, and the next agent picks up a real handoff: where you left
  off, what failed, what's still open. Handoffs are a protocol here, not a
  convention — typed, owned, claimed exactly once.

- **It follows you across machines.** Memory lives in a server you run —
  on the same laptop, a homelab box, or wherever — so the project you left
  on the desktop is the project you resume on the laptop. Same knowledge,
  same open questions.

- **It works for a team.** Point everyone at one server and what one
  person's sessions learn, everyone's agents can retrieve. Knowledge is
  shared per project; personal handoffs stay personal. Multi-user auth,
  per-person attribution, and an audit log are built in — not a paid tier.

- **Your memory is plain markdown.** The source of truth is a git-backed
  wiki of ordinary `.md` files: `grep` it, open it in Obsidian, edit it by
  hand, `rsync` it. The database is a derived index that can always be
  rebuilt from the files. No vector store to babysit, nothing held hostage
  in a binary blob.

- **It captures the work itself, silently.** Lifecycle hooks record what
  actually happened — prompts, tool calls, session boundaries — sanitized
  at a typed privacy boundary before anything is stored, then consolidated
  into readable pages. No "remember this" ceremony. And the default path
  uses **zero LLM calls**: capture, search, and handoffs all work with no
  API key at all.

- **It tells you the truth about itself.** One self-contained binary.
  Purge commands that say exactly what "deleted" means. A measured write
  ceiling (~700/s) instead of a guessed one. An audit log of every
  mutation. Boring, in the way infrastructure should be.

## How it works

```
capture ──▶ consolidate ──▶ recall ──▶ handoff
 hooks        session-end      search     next agent,
 observe      summaries as     + brief    any harness
 silently     wiki pages       injection
```

Agents emit sanitized observations through lifecycle hooks as you work.
At session end, observations become coherent markdown pages in the
project's wiki (optionally LLM-written; useful even without). The next
session — any agent, any machine — gets a bounded brief and can search
everything: full-text, entities, links, and (optionally) vectors, fused
into one ranking. Cross-agent handoffs carry the baton explicitly.

The full design, including the invariants that keep multi-user and
multi-session use safe, is in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Support matrix

Every row below is a first-party integration — MCP registration, lifecycle
hooks, or both — kept honest by CI. The full matrix with per-agent notes and
caveats is in [`docs/support-matrix.md`](docs/support-matrix.md).

## Quick start

### Arch Linux (AUR)

For native Arch installs, use the AUR packages. They install
`/usr/bin/ai-memory`, packaged hook sources, and both system-level and
user-level systemd units.

```bash
yay -S ai-memory-bin    # prebuilt Linux x86_64/aarch64 binary
yay -S ai-memory        # builds from source
```

Single-user workstation:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/ai-memory ~/.local/share/ai-memory
ai-memory --data-dir ~/.local/share/ai-memory \
  --config ~/.config/ai-memory/config.toml init
systemctl --user enable --now ai-memory.service
ai-memory install-mcp --client claude-code --apply
ai-memory install-hooks --agent claude-code --apply
```

System service installs use `/var/lib/ai-memory` and `/etc/ai-memory/` via the
packaged unit. Full user-service, system-service, auth, and provider setup is in
[`docs/install.md#arch-linux-native-packages-aur`](docs/install.md#arch-linux-native-packages-aur).

### Docker

You need: Docker + an agent CLI from the [Support Matrix](#support-matrix), or
anything else that speaks MCP.

The published Docker image includes `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` variants,
so Apple Silicon Macs and ARM64 Linux hosts can pull `akitaonrails/ai-memory`
without `--platform linux/amd64` emulation.

The default quick-start has **no authentication** - the server binds
to loopback only, so on a single-user laptop nothing else can reach
it. Adding a bearer token is a one-line change once you're ready to
expose the server on the LAN; see [Security](#security) below.

```bash
# 1. Install the ai-memory CLI wrapper (a small shell script that
#    runs the binary inside docker with your $HOME mounted). This is
#    the only thing that needs to live on the host filesystem.
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
wrapper_tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
trap 'rm -rf "$wrapper_tmp"' EXIT
wrapper_base=https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory/releases/latest/download/ai-memory-wrapper
curl -fsSL "$wrapper_base" -o "$wrapper_tmp/ai-memory-wrapper"
curl -fsSL "$wrapper_base.sha256" -o "$wrapper_tmp/ai-memory-wrapper.sha256"
expected="$(awk 'NR == 1 { print $1 }' "$wrapper_tmp/ai-memory-wrapper.sha256")"
if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    actual="$(sha256sum "$wrapper_tmp/ai-memory-wrapper" | awk '{ print $1 }')"
else
    actual="$(shasum -a 256 "$wrapper_tmp/ai-memory-wrapper" | awk '{ print $1 }')"
fi
[ -n "$expected" ] && [ "$actual" = "$expected" ] || { echo "wrapper checksum mismatch" >&2; exit 1; }
install -m 0755 "$wrapper_tmp/ai-memory-wrapper" ~/.local/bin/ai-memory
rm -rf "$wrapper_tmp"
trap - EXIT
# Most distros put ~/.local/bin on PATH automatically. If `which
# ai-memory` comes up empty, add this to ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc:
#     export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# 2. Start the server. `--restart unless-stopped` makes it come back
#    on docker daemon restart and on machine boot (provided your
#    docker service is enabled at boot — `sudo systemctl enable
#    docker` on most distros). Loopback-only bind (`127.0.0.1:49374`)
#    so nothing outside this machine can reach it. Omit the LLM /
#    EMBEDDING lines for zero-LLM mode — FTS5 search still works
#    without any keys.
docker run -d --name ai-memory \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 127.0.0.1:49374:49374 \
    -v ai-memory-data:/data \
    -e AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic \
    -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
    -e AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai \
    -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
    akitaonrails/ai-memory:latest

# 3. Wire your agent CLI in two commands. The wrapper takes care of
#    mounts and each client's config-path detection. Re-run with
#    `--agent codex`, `--agent command-code`, `--agent devin`, `--agent opencode`, `--agent gemini-cli`,
#    `--agent grok`, `--agent kimi-code`, `--agent kiro-cli`, `--agent omp`,
#    `--agent oh-my-pi`, `--client cursor`,
#    `--client gemini-cli`, `--client grok`, `--client kiro-cli`, etc.
#    for additional agents; full list in docs/install.md.
ai-memory install-mcp   --client claude-code --apply
ai-memory install-hooks --agent  claude-code --apply
```

On Linux/macOS, that's it. Start a Claude Code session as usual - every
prompt and tool call now lands in ai-memory, and the next session you
open in this project will see a handoff with where you left off.
On macOS, the native release binary is also supported and recommended when you
do not need Docker; see [`docs/macos.md`](docs/macos.md).

Wiring another agent is the same two commands with a different name —
`--client codex`, `--agent codex`, and so on for every row of the support
matrix. The full per-agent guide, including Windows and remote servers, is
[`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md).

Two agents in the same project at once, or teammates on one server? That
works out of the box: the "current project" pointer is isolated per caller
by default (v1.39+). See [`docs/auto-scope.md`](docs/auto-scope.md) for the
optional session-aware Claude Code bridge and the details.

Managed workstreams are optional and add cross-harness *session* continuity
on top of shared memory:

```bash
ai-memory run claude
ai-memory run codex --yolo   # later: same workstream, different harness
ai-memory continue           # resume the newest managed checkout
```

`ai-memory uninstall --apply` removes everything ai-memory installed,
and only what it installed. Install commands are idempotent and write
timestamped backups next to any file they touch.

## Everyday use

Day to day, you mostly do not think about ai-memory. Hooks capture
prompts, tool calls, and session boundaries; session end turns them into
readable wiki pages; the next session starts with a handoff.

- Ask "where did we leave off?" to continue from the pending handoff.
- Ask "have we discussed X?" or "search memory for Y" to query the wiki.
- Ask "catch me up" for a prose digest of recent project activity.
- Run `ai-memory bootstrap` once when adopting an existing project with
  months of history.
- Start the server with `--enable-web` for a read-only browser view of
  the wiki and a JSON API under `/api/v1`.

The full tour — search modes, entities, feedback, briefings, the web
API — is in [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md) and
[`docs/use-cases.md`](docs/use-cases.md).

## Teams and multiple machines

Run the server somewhere reachable — a homelab box, a LAN host — and
point every machine and every teammate at it. Knowledge is shared per
project; personal handoffs stay personal; every write is attributed and
audited. Multi-user auth (passwords, API credentials) is built in.

Start with [`docs/users.md`](docs/users.md) for accounts and ownership,
and [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md) for the server itself — including
capacity numbers measured rather than guessed, and the one rule that
matters: one server per data directory, never two.

## Security

The quick-start default is loopback-only with no auth — nothing outside
your machine can reach it. From there, hardening is incremental: a bearer
token for the LAN, per-user accounts, OIDC device auth for hooks, TLS via
a reverse proxy. Capture is sanitized at a typed privacy boundary before
anything is stored, and per-repository `[capture]` rules can exclude
paths or invert to allowlist mode.

The full model is in [`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md),
[`docs/users.md`](docs/users.md), and
[`docs/https-via-proxy.md`](docs/https-via-proxy.md).

## LLM providers

Optional. Everything works with zero LLM calls; adding a provider
upgrades session summaries and enables semantic search. Anthropic,
OpenAI (incl. OAuth/Codex), GitHub Copilot, Gemini, OpenCode Zen, and
any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM) are supported
for consolidation; OpenAI, Voyage, Gemini, and keyless OpenAI-compatible
endpoints for embeddings. Configuration lives in
[`docs/llm-providers.md`](docs/llm-providers.md).

## Architecture

One Rust binary runs an MCP/HTTP server and owns one data directory:

```text
<data_dir>/
├── wiki/    # markdown source of truth, git-versioned
├── raw/     # immutable sanitized managed-workstream transcript segments
├── db/      # SQLite indexes, including FTS5, entities, and embeddings
├── models/  # reserved for local embedding models
└── logs/    # rolling tracing output
```

Hooks POST observations to the server. The server serializes writes
through one SQLite writer, compiles session observations into markdown
pages, and serves retrieval through FTS5, entity-match and graph-neighbor RRF,
optional vector RRF, bounded source-authority adjustment, and bounded
raw-observation fallback for non-global searches.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the data-flow
diagram, crate breakdown, schema notes, and invariants.
